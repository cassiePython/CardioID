# Introduction

This is a pytorch implementation of ResNet [0] and ResNeXt [1] on one-dimensional data classification. 

# Usage

```
# test on synthetic data
python test_synthetic.py

# test on PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 data
python test_physionet.py
```

# Requirements

python 3.7.5, pytorch 1.2.0


# Applications

## ECG Classification (PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017)

Dataset: "AF Classification from a short single lead ECG recording". Data can be found at https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2017/#challenge-data Please use Revised labels (v3) at https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2017/REFERENCE-v3.csv

The model has been used in one of the First place solution (F1=0.83) [2, 3]. The original tensorflow (tflearn) version can be found at https://github.com/hsd1503/ENCASE.
